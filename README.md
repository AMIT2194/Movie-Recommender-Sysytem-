# Movie Recommender System

The Movie Recommender System is a project that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies that are likely to be of interest to the user, taking into account their historical movie ratings and preferences.
## Features

- **User-based Recommendations**: The system analyzes the ratings and preferences of similar users to recommend movies that align with the user's taste.

- **Item-based Recommendations**: The system identifies similar movies based on their attributes and recommends movies that are similar to the ones the user has enjoyed in the past.

- **Hybrid Recommendations**: The system combines both user-based and item-based approaches to generate hybrid recommendations, providing a broader range of movie suggestions.

- **Rating Predictions**: The system predicts the user's ratings for movies they haven't seen yet, enabling personalized recommendations even for unseen movies.

- **Web Interface**: The system includes a user-friendly web interface where users can interact with the recommender system, browse movie recommendations, and provide feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is developed primarily using the Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning tasks.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: The recommender system employs collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user behavior and generate accurate movie recommendations.

- **Text Vectorization**: The process used to find simalrity between the textual data so that one line of text can be compared to other and a certain kind of similarity can be found between the two



## Dataset

The project utilizes a movie dataset containing information about movies, genre , cast, crew members , overview  and other relevant attributes. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle , and it includes a diverse collection of movies across different genres and time periods.
